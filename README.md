## 🌍 Project Overview

**Green Scorecard** is a real-time ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) monitoring dashboard designed to simulate and visualize sustainability compliance across multiple organizations. This project helps stakeholders detect where operational practices fall short of ESG benchmarks—before fines, PR fallout, or regulatory action hit.

It features interactive visuals, a risk alert system, and a predictive model that flags companies at high risk of non-compliance.

🎯 **Why it matters**: As sustainability regulations tighten, businesses need tools that *do more than report*. They need dashboards that *warn, predict, and guide corrective action*. That’s what Green Scorecard delivers.

## 🔧 Features Planned

- **Simulated ESG dataset** with emissions, diversity, energy, and governance metrics
- **Live dashboard** (Streamlit) with:
  - ESG benchmark comparisons
  - Real-time compliance deviation alerts
  - Risk clustering & failure reason breakdown
  - "What-if" scenario analysis for proactive planning
- **Machine Learning model** to predict ESG compliance risk using company-level data

---

## 🚀 Roadmap Highlights

- [ ] Build ESG benchmark references and realistic simulated data  
- [ ] Visualize % deviation from compliance targets by category (E/S/G)  
- [ ] Implement risk prediction model (Logistic Regression or Tree-Based)  
- [ ] Build alert system (e.g., if >10% of entities fail E or S thresholds)  
- [ ] Add interactive what-if sliders to test policy impact
